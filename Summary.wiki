= Comparing individual-based approaches to modelling the self-organization of multicellular tissues =

Welcome to the Chaste wiki.

This section contains pages generated automatically from the source code accompanying Comparing individual-based approaches to modelling the self-organization of multicellular tissues, 
our paper submitted to Royal Society Interface 

== Getting the code and installing dependencies ==

Before running these examples you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.4].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on [wiki:InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage]. 
Note that Chaste is only fully supported on !Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X may need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

'''NB''': the paper was developed with release version 3.4 of Chaste. It does not work with release version 3.3 or under. It may need updating to work on newer revisions of the trunk code.

You will also need the source for the CellBasedComparison project.  This can be done by checking out the version from the repository by using the command 
{{{
svn checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/CellBasedComparison
}}}
in the projects folder of the Chaste directory. 

Now the project should be installed, and everything should compile and run correctly. 
You can now run the tests or simulations, or create your own test suites.

== Documentation ==
There are two folders - `src` and `test`.
 1. The `src` folder contains the following classes:
  * `TODO.xpp` - Modifier class to ... TODO
  * `TODO.xpp` - A version of the [https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/public-docs/classSimpleWntCellCycleModel.html SimpleWntCellCycleModel] class to ...  TODO
 1. The `test` folder contains:
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/CellBasedComparison/CellSorting TestCellSortingLiteratePaper.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure XXX.
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/CellBasedComparison/CylindricalCrypt TestCylindricalCryptLiteratePaper.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure XXX.
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/CellBasedComparison/DeltaNotch TestDeltaNotchLiteratePaper.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure XXX.
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/CellBasedComparison/MorphogenMonolayer TestMorphogenMonolayerLiteratePaper.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure XXX.

== Running tests ==
You can then run tests and simulations with,
{{{
cd <Chaste3.4 path>
scons b=GccOpt ts=projects/CellBasedComparison/test/TestCellSortingLiteratePaper.hpp
}}}
etc.

'''NB''': the paper was developed with release version 3.4. It will not work with with release version 3.3 or under.
